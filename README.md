# EDA-on-Netflix
📊 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization
🔍 Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization are essential steps in understanding and extracting meaningful insights from datasets — including those related to Netflix.
EDA helps summarize the main characteristics of the data, often using statistical graphics and plots. Visualization further enhances our understanding by making it easier to detect patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

This project focuses on applying EDA techniques to Netflix's dataset to explore and analyze various aspects of its content.

📂 Project Overview

This repository contains the following components:

✅ Data Collection
Loading and understanding the raw dataset related to Netflix shows and movies.

🧹 Data Cleaning
Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates to ensure data quality.

📈 Univariate Analysis
Analyzing single variables using histograms, count plots, and summary statistics.

📊 Bivariate Analysis
Exploring relationships between two variables — e.g., release year vs. rating, or type vs. duration.

🎭 Genre Analysis
Investigating the distribution and popularity of different genres.

📺 Content Analysis
